Nike's research and several other independent ones claim that the\r\n            shoe gives a 4% performance boost for runners and it is pretty clear that\r\n            they work looking at the recent records that were shattered especially\r\n            the one Eliud Kipchoge set by running a full marathon in just under two\r\n            hours. With such a feat came controversies. There are rumours that the\r\n            shoe will likely be banned before the Tokyo Olympic Games as it provides\r\n            an unfair advantage to the wearer. But let us look at the other side of\r\n            the coin.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The Vaporfly is now a case of milage - In other words, how small improvements\r\n            can go a long way for an athlete with a career in running. Many athletes\r\n            retire from sports every year. Most of them, we never hear from ever again\r\n            on a large stage. Now you may argue that these celebrities, these athletes\r\n            have made some good decision along their career to enable a smooth retirement\r\n            where their investments and their prior deals bring in money to sustain their\r\n            lives but most don't end up in rich mansion on a cliff staring the ocean.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Why is Vaporfly an unfair advantage? Only because you can't run in them once\r\n            you have been signed on by Adidas. Kidding aside, ability to sustain their\r\n            prime time for a longer duration can help these athletes a lot in the long\r\n            run - not only the run on the track but also the run of their life. The ability\r\n            to compete for a little longer is the straw any athlete would take in this\r\n            super competitive industry.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <kbd>Using it is same as doping!</kbd> Now that I think is debatable. Doping\r\n            provides you with a transformation enabling you to put in far more than you\r\n            could prior to doping but Nike simply reduces the energy lost per step. It's\r\n            not like mother Earth is pushing you up magically to enable you to outperform\r\n            the others.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In the end I think Vaporfly marks a new milestone in shoe industry despite\r\n            the controversy surrounding it. Does it make you better instantly? Yes, but\r\n            it also enables you to push forward without flying too close to the sun. In\r\n            the long run, it's benefits may just enable us to watch our favorite\r\n            athletes compete longer without dropping out keeping us jammed to the\r\n            television sets and them jammed at the sport. \r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Vaporfly;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport './article.css';\r\n\r\nfunction Users(props) {\r\n  const {router} = props;\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"stage-container\">\r\n      <div className=\"stage\">\r\n        {/*eslint-disable-next-line*/}\r\n        <a className=\"link\" onClick={() => router('/')}>\r\n          <kbd className=\"arrow\">◀</kbd> Go Back\r\n        </a>\r\n        <p className=\"headline\">\r\n          How the user makes or breaks your product!\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"date\">\r\n          4th April, 2020\r\n        </p>\r\n        <div className=\"post-body\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            <kbd>User</kbd> is the target any organization sets when it develops a\r\n            product. Without them, there is no realy use for what we develop. There\r\n            is a reason why <kbd>Amazon</kbd>, a company that focuses obsessively about\r\n            it's customers is one of the few companies that hit the trillion dollar mark\r\n            and continues to hover around that number consistently. Amazon as a company\r\n            would be nowhere without the millions of people ordering goods onlie everyday\r\n            and they have made it their missin to cater to their needs 24 X 7.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Keeping things simple is the way they do it. Amazon doesn't have the most\r\n            sophisticated user interface. It looks like a website deriving it's styles\r\n            from the past decade but it works for them. Sometimes it's not all about the\r\n            charms. For Amazon it's about keeping the non-essential features to minimum\r\n            and ease up buying and selling for all generations. It doesn't matter if you\r\n            are a 60 year old with limited knowledge of the internet or a millenial who\r\n            can't take his eyes off the smartphone; In either cases, one shouldn't have\r\n            any problem in getting the product that they need. Same stand sfor sellers.\r\n            If you have something to sell, Amazon will make it effortless for you to\r\n            reach the customers you need. \r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <kbd>Why am I talking about this?</kbd> I use Manjaro based on GNU/Linux\r\n            for most of my day to day task and use Firefox nightly for website testing.\r\n            The problem is most of my users are on Windows using stable version of Chrome.\r\n            In other words, a large chunk of y users may have an inconsistent experience\r\n            from what I imagined it to be mostly because I'm developing on a platform that\r\n            not many of my users use and for a browser that offers feature way ahead of time.\r\n            Don't get me wrong, browsers today have takes a lot of steps to make the\r\n            experience consistent across each other but some aspects like fonts and ceratin\r\n            CSS properties that may not behave consistently across all of them.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            I now make it a point to hop on over to Windows and test everyrhing I build.\r\n            Everything from a desktop to a mobile viewport, should have a consistent\r\n            experience, te way developer meant it to be. Sometimes, you need to go the\r\n            extra mile to navigate to the Windows option in the GRUB menu to make sure\r\n            your user sees exactly what you want him to see.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Focusing on user has never been bad. Look at Microsoft and how they managed to\r\n            turn fumm 180 by focusing on their customer base and enhancing the infrastructure\r\n            that matters. They trimmed the fat [Remember Windows Phone?!], and doubled down\r\n            on cloud and their profession suite and that was one of the smartest move they\r\n            made. They have actively taken part in open source publishing some of the\r\n            major projects such as Typescript and VS Code, to acquiring Github and now the\r\n            Node PAckage Manager [NPM] only strengthening their bond with the community.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Google has been doing it forever keeping things simple for their users and\r\n            actively endorsing open source. Same is the principle with Facebook, Instagram,\r\n            and other pieces of successful software. Netflix brought convenience to people's\r\n            homes by enabling them to access the large catalogue of movies and shows on a \r\n            subscripton basis.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In the end, all I say is this: <kbd>Don't build a product just because it looks\r\n            cool or has fancy features.
