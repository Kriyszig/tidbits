Nike's research and several other independent ones claim that the shoe gives a 4% performance boost for runners and it is pretty clear that they work looking at the recent records that were shattered especially the one Eliud Kipchoge set by running a full marathon in just under two hours. With such a feat came controversies. There are rumours that the shoe will likely be banned before the Tokyo Olympic Games as it provides an unfair advantage to the wearer. But let us look at the other side of the coin."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"The Vaporfly is now a case of milage - In other words, how small improvements can go a long way for an athlete with a career in running. Many athletes retire from sports every year. Most of them, we never hear from ever again on a large stage.

Only because you can't run in them once you have been signed on by Adidas. Kidding aside, ability to sustain their prime time for a longer duration can help these athletes a lot in the long run - not only the run on the track but also the run of their life. The ability to compete for a little longer is the straw any athlete would take in this super competitive industry."),r.a.createElement("p",null,r.a.createElement("kbd",null,"Using it is same as doping!")," Now that I think is debatable.

Does it make you better instantly? Yes, but it also enables you to push forward without flying too close to the sun. In the long run, it's benefits may just enable us to watch our favorite athletes compete longer without dropping out keeping us jammed to the television sets and them jammed at the sport."))))};a(16);var f=function(){var e=Object(n.useState)("/"),t=Object(i.a)(e,2),a=t[0],o=t[1];return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"hero-container"},r.a.createElement(s,null),"/"===a?r.a.createElement(d,{router:o}):"fly"===a?r.a.createElement(p,{router:o}):"")};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));l.a.render(r.a.createElement(f,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()}))}],[[5,1,2]]]);
